1. Project Idea

Gamified Habit Tracker  

A web application that allows users to create and manage personal habits, track daily/weekly completions, and earn points or “XP” for staying consistent. The app also features streak tracking, and optionally a leaderboard or personal score display. Once a user logs in, they land on a unified dashboard page with a sidebar and main content area (populated via partials) that shows their habits, stats, and forms to create/edit habits.

Key Features

- User Authentication: New users can register and existing users can log in.  
- Dashboard: A single-page dashboard (once logged in) with a sidebar for navigation and a main content area for viewing/modifying habits, progress, and scores.  
- Habit Creation & Management: Users can create habits with a name, frequency (daily, weekly, etc.), and optionally a description or category.  
- Completion Tracking: Each day or week, a user checks off completion for that habit, which increases streak count and XP.  
- Streaks & XP: Keep track of how many consecutive days/weeks a user has maintained a habit. Award XP to reflect progress and provide motivation.  
- Optional Scoreboard/Leaderboard: Display user rankings or personal stats in a scoreboard partial.

3. User Stories

1. Registration & Login  
   - As a new user, I want to create an account so I can securely log in and track my habits.  
   - As a returning user, I want to log in so I can view and update my habits and progress.

2. Dashboard & Navigation  
   - As a logged-in user, I want to see a sidebar with quick links (Habits, Scoreboard, Logout) so I can easily navigate the app.  
   - As a logged-in user, I want to see my most important stats (like total XP and current streaks) on the main dashboard screen.

3. Habit Creation & Management  
   - As a user, I want to create new habits with a name and frequency, so I can begin tracking them.  
   - As a user, I want to see a list of all my habits, so I can quickly choose which to check off for the day.  
   - As a user, I want to edit or delete habits, so I can keep my habit list up to date.

4. Tracking Completions & Streaks  
   - As a user, I want to mark a habit as completed for the current day (or week), so I can maintain my streak.  
   - As a user, I want to see my streak and how many consecutive days/weeks I’ve completed a habit, so I feel motivated to continue.

5. Gamification  
   - As a user, I want to earn XP or points each time I complete a habit, so I’m incentivized to keep going.  
   - As a user, I want to see my total XP on my dashboard, so I can track my overall progress.

6. Optional: Scoreboard/Leaderboard  
   - As a user, I want to compare my progress with other users (or see a personal scoreboard), so I have extra motivation to stick with my habits.




4. ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)


- User (1) — (M) Habit: Each user can have many habits.  
- Habit (1) — (M) Completion: Each habit can have many completion entries (one per day/week).

- User: Stores user credentials and totalXP (or you might store XP in a separate doc, but typically it’s fine here).
- Habit: Includes the userId reference to the user who owns the habit, plus details like name, frequency, etc.
- Completion: Each entry references the specific habitId to track daily completions. This could store how much XP was awarded, or you can compute the XP on the fly.
